# IPL-Win-Prediction
This project uses historical IPL data to predict match outcomes using machine learning. It analyzes delivery-level and match-level data to engineer features like run rate, wickets left, and target score. A classification model is trained to predict whether the chasing team will win based on live match conditions after the first innings.
